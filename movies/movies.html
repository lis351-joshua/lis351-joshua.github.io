        <h2>1. whiplash</h2>
        <p>I watched Whiplash recently yet I loved every minute of it. It is about a young drummer that aspires to be the greatest musician who goes through a music institute ran by a dreaded instructor who is known to push musicians past their limit. It's a powerful journey depicting the drummer's eventual loss of sanity in favor of being the best drummer he can be. A 10/10 film overall.</p>
        <h2>2. dune</h2>
        <p>The Dune movies are adaptations of the books written by Frank Herbert. The series is about a boy that is part of a family that moves to a disputed planet, and is destined to rule the enitre universe. The series is arguably the greatest sci-fi novel of all time, and the movies are a great adaptation of it.</p>
        <h2>3. lord of the rings movies</h2>
        <p>Much like Dune, the Lord of the Rings is also originally a book series that ended up turning into a series of movies. As I wrote about in the books section of this website, the Lord of the Rings series is iconic, and the movies only solidiy it.</p>
