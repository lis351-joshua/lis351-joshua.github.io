            <li>reading</li>
            <p>Although I haven't been the most consistent with this, I do enjoy reading books - primarily non-fiction
                nowadays, but I enjoy a bit of fiction here and there. I love learning new things, and books have been a
                great way to help with that. Right now, I am reading the Million Dollar Weekend by Noah Kagan to learn a
                thing or two about how businesses operate and startup culture.</p>

            <li>basketball</li>
            <p>I love playing and watching basketball. I have played basketball since I was just 9 years old (and yet,
                I'm still not very good!) and have loved it since. I've only played in casual settings - I've never
                played in a high school team, but I still enjoy playing it with my friends. I'm also a fan of the Golden
                State Warriors as I used to live in the Bay Area before moving to Maryland for a few years.</p>

            <li>movies</li>
            <p>I also enjoy watching movies here and there. I've mostly watched the classics - we're talking Robert de
                Niro, Al Pacino, and Martin Scorsese-directed movies. I do also enjoy a few modern (2010-2025) movies
                here and there.</p>
