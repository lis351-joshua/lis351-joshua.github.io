        <h2>1. meditations - marcus aurelius</h2>
        <div class="book-flex">
            <p>One of my favorite books I've read has to be Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. This book is essentially a
                journal that contained Stoic ideas from Aurelius hismelf. To me, this book is a very good introduction
                to anyone that wants to break into Stoic philosophy, as it's a relatively easy read without an absurd
                amount of jargon. Below are a few quotes I found to be the most profound from this book!</p>
            <img src=".././assets/images/IMG_5327.JPG"
                alt="Two of my favorite quotes from Meditations\n1) Do external things distract you? Then make time for yourself to learn something worthwhile; stop letting yourself be pulled in all directions. But make sure you guard against the other kind of confusion. People who labor all their lives but have no purpose to direct every thought and impulse are wasting their time - even when hard at work.\n2) Ignoring what goes on in other people's souls - no one ever came to grief that way. But if you won't keep track of what your own soul's doing, how can you not be unhappy?"

        <h2>2. the lord of the rings trilogy - jrr tolkien</h2>
        <div class="book-flex">
            <p>This is probably up there with my favorite fiction series of all time. The Lord of the Rings is about a
                character who gets gifted a ring that can make the bearer invisible. The catch is that the ring also has
                the capability to corrupt the bearer with evil, so the main character and his friends seek out to
                destroy the ring at the Cracks of Doom, the only place that can destroy it. It's a great adventure from
                book 1 to 3, and I highly recommend it to any book enjoyer of any age!</p>

        <h2>3. the adventures of sherlock holmes - sir arthur conan doyle</h2>
        <div class="book-flex">
            <p>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of around 10 short stories about the iconic detective
                Sherlock Holmes and his adventures in cracking the toughest criminal cases. With his ingenious tactics,
                him cracking various criminal cases makes this book a fun, thrilling and entertaining read, and I highly
                recommend it to anyone that wants a short, nice read. </p>
